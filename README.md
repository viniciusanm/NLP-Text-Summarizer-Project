Welcome to the NLP Text Summarizer project repository! This project aims to provide an efficient and scalable solution for automatically summarizing text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The summarizer is built using PyTorch for model development, Docker for containerization, AWS for deployment, and FastAPI for creating the API endpoints.

## Features

- **Text Summarization**: Automatically generate concise summaries from input text.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Utilize Docker for easy containerization and AWS for scalable deployment.
- **API Endpoint**: Expose summarization functionality through FastAPI, allowing seamless integration with other applications.
